  title: Trashcore
  sections:
  - heading: Overview
    text: Read image buffer. Convert rgb to YCbCr. Downsample the Y (brightness) channel fuzz number of times. Downsample the flat chroma (combined CbCr channels at midtone brightness) based on cronch. Quantize each channel based on crunch. 
  - heading: Fuzz
    text: Size of distortion in value channel.

    url:
  - heading: Cronch
    text: Level of chroma subsampling. Unlike the actual jpeg compression, the subsampling level is independent of the fuzz factor so the artist has more direct control of this factor.
  - heading: Crunch
    text: Number of levels when posterizing flat chroma post DCT.
  - heading: Nihilism Compression Algorithm
    text: Converts one (monochromatic) channel to a gradient from the minimum value pixel to the maximum value pixel.
